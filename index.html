<p>
  <em>James was never a rabid man -- he liked to exercise restraint above all things corporeal. He ate his meals with measured purpose, he exercised enough to keep his physique in shape, and he slept nine hours a day, not a wink more or less. He had his life under control. The only thing he cultivated was his thirst for knowledge. And for the longest time, he thought sex was an act below him, for he believed he was the next step in human evolution -- only touching himself strictly when necessary, or as means to an end, seducing women and men alike to cement his position in the institute... until he met her.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>Lockely, a chemistry savant, famously had a stick up in her arse. And despite being well-respected among her peers, she had no friendships to boast of. They called her otter in secret. She largely worked alone, and the only time he was made aware of her presence was when he was trying to procure research papers on nuclear fission with uranium. The boffin admin admonished him for straying away from his department but told him who had access to it anyhow.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>He had half a mind to sweet talk her into giving the papers up, but when she looked him in the eye appraisingly and asked, "If you develop a much more effective way of filtering carbonate from seawater, you can collect 4 million tons of uranium from the oceans." She grabbed a book from the department shelves and shoved it onto his lap. He read the cover text -- It was the Nine Jamesorrows by Isaac Asimov. He'd come across his work before -- and hated, loathed, Nightfall for he considered it anti-intellectual in its very core -- how could knowledge cause great minds to go insane?</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>"I am not interested in science fiction, speculative or not." He mused, flipping the book's pages out of habit.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>Emma narrowed her eyes and spoke in a low voice of equal parts mirth and disdain. "It was worth a try, distracting you." Her hands were already full of boxes of what seemed like research on nuclear fission.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>She had him figured out -- how she discovered her desire to beat entropy, was not important. He can investigate later.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>He declared her his partner-in-crime in his head and engaged her in unending debates on several thermodynamic concepts. It was far from her expertise, but she took his ideas apart with razor sharp attention to details. She acknowledged his theories were far better than their seniors but warned him with a cliché -- nothing is forever.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>In the end, he took the Asimov book with him and read it that night. James was eager to form an opinion of it and found Multivac lacking in complexity. A machine like it, he suppositioned will never decipher the hidden intricacies of the working universe. It was another children's story, too simple of a narrative for men like him, in spite of the prose that weaved around it.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>The next morning, he sought her out to discuss Murphy's law in earnest. She did not dismiss him as he expected, rather, the woman asked for a list of non-fictional literature he felt was worth recommending. It was a chance to sway her to his side. Why he longed for some common ground, he casually reasoned, was borne all out of utility.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>She called him a bigot or some form of an insult, most days underhanded. And he thought she was the incorrigible one. Still, he kept his pristine façade in public. He extended his help when she needed it the most. Her unpublished research on syntropy proved to be paramount to his success in creating artificial consciousness that can house five-minute memories pulled from neural networks. He won an award for it, which he shared with her during his acceptance speech.</em>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <em>And then one night, exactly seven months later, single-minded James Lloyd, second of his name, fell apart over Emma Lockely, and took what he never imagined he wanted out of life. His methods were effectual -- he accepted no defeat. And he did not fail to intertwine his life with hers in all aspects of knowingness.</em>
</p>

<p> </p><hr />

<p> </p>

<p>He couldn't wait until midnight -- he reasoned gifting was too important to delay for a few hours when they have not seen each other in months.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Emma, ever the reluctant people pleaser, pulls on the festive coloured ribbons and opens the box gingerly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A ruby pendant strung in gold reveals itself to her, the stone, grown in a laboratory according to his specifications, he explains in delight, but just as beautiful, if not, more perfectly so. She holds it up and examines it with a scientific amusement and catches the fairy lights dance on each facet like some forbidden magic of long ago.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She allows it to rest just over her feeble heart as he wastes no time closing its clasp around her neck, placing a small caress there, a wet kiss, a lover's bite to seal the gesture. Although she believes her lover's claims of ingenuity, she still imagines his experimental methods differently: he would've extracted his precious blood to make it 'personal'; freezing it dry in a vacuum chamber -- a lyophiliser -- they've worked on one before at Cambridge with funding from Biopharma Group; and encasing it UL-752 unbreakable glass or Baltic amber for safekeeping.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James Lloyd has always been fascinated with DNA preservation. When he was 16, he signed up as a test subject for Flexmort's DNA pre-planning. He has made great strides in his leisurely pace of learning the wonders of nucleic acids since then. She shudders at the thought of eugenics, and other unethical genetic engineering practices, of which she is not certain James has partaken in.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He tells her she's beautiful. She finds him, terribly so. The world is, tonight, she notes. It must be because of the view from the alcove window, the foot-deep snow extending beyond their porch, hanging over wrought iron Victorian balustrades, with rows and rows of Aspen trees, tops powdered by newly fallen snow as the backdrop. The effect looks positively Sabattier.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James's extended ramblings do not really impress most people inasmuch as they hardly understand an inkling how his mind works on overdrive. And the holidays call for exchanges rooted in merrymaking anyway, they point out, never academics. Politics, sports or any other form of entertainment, or ideas of baseless conjecture -- all far more preferable than the colourful history of steam engines, much less the future of nuclear. So he sticks to these safer subjects over coq au vin and fresh mussels. Emma watches his audience fall over themselves with childlike wonder like how she would observe a West End production -- James obviously, is the anti-protagonist of the story, as he deviously makes the souring situation work in his favour -- changing his tone to that of a seducer and offers compliments to their progress in oil refinery.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>People like it when other people pay attention to them -- and Emma figures this is the way James maintains absolute control of this posse of eclectic people. If not through persuasion, then through feigned interest. So long as they hear any form of praise from the man, they will find it hard to defy him. How most of them cannot see through his affable demeanor and fake candour puzzles her. Maybe women have better intuitions, she decides. She hears the word 'brilliant' too many times than she can possibly stand, probably as much as she's seen him flash his sharp teeth with malicious glee during the whole event and decides she’s had enough.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Emma excuses herself to sit by the fireplace, its low embers and crackling sounds a safe refuge from pretensions of the social kind. Everyone eats out of the palm of James's hand. She is no exception, but a time out is more than welcome. She starts to read a book she fished out from the small pile over the mantel randomly and wonders, no, realises around three pages in that the literature in question is a torrid re-telling of Sleeping Beauty’s tale, involving harems with an unlimited desire to receive abuse from the Crown Prince. She slams it shut in disgust.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After conversations over the exhaustive, five-course dinner with a few dignitaries -- head researchers and data scientists from Cambridge, along with their old friends at the UKERC (James's friends, if she was being honest) who had then left for their own homes for Christmas Eve have died down, Emma finds herself washing the dishes while James drones on, never missing a beat on alternative energy sources, specifically, he intones, how wind turbines can potentially work to power the whole country. His vigour for his pet project is enrapturing, if not infectious. He is a 120-piece orchestra conductor and he commands her attention by detailing his ambitions for himself, because she has similar goals of her own. This is James at his apex, she surmises. He is restless as he is insatiable. She keeps her hands on the soup bowl and sponge; her hand itches if she does nothing with it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"The current solution could be better. We can harness the energy twice the efficiency with lighter rotors, we can go through the specifics another time,"</strong> he explains, while his distracting index finger torturously drags the hem of her dress higher. <strong>"The challenge is in deployment, and companies scared of alternative energy in wind power."</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>She hears herself sigh. <strong>"Your colleagues will probably immediately approve of your methods. They never fail to."</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>To which he replies, <strong>"Well. It does do well to remain unchallenged. The easier the climb, the better."</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"Lackeys." </strong>The word disgusts her. She understands the need to gain influence over their peers, but she expected more out of them, more than being Yes men. James had worked tirelessly to receive funding on R&amp;D for the better part of five years. It would have taken half the time to do so had they helped him with any proof of work. She thought the nature of his job, akin to a marketer or a salesman, was quite undignified, but he asserted, at the time, that it was just means to an end. He explained that he was after a few things as well outside of UKERC jurisdiction -- and during his last year of involvement he was granted access to a lab that housed scientific curiosities care of Dr. Harriet Armstrong. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"Humidity -- it will pose a huge problem for this project of yours. I suppose this supports hydropower, you do aim to spur innovation, do you not?"</strong> Emma offers tonelessly, disguising her need to challenge him. <strong>"Or thermal energy,"</strong> she adds, unable to help herself.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He closes in on her and whispers in mock conspiration, <strong>"That's the idea. Collecting is half the battle. Thermal energy storage is the future. But it's all theoretical, for now, and we desperately need more funding."</strong> His team was never going to get any, she heard him discussing this earlier with Alecto Carrow. He was leading her on, all this talk was definitely going somewhere they've never went to before. James's touches crawl a little higher each time he speaks. Higher.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He pauses and moves behind her, his body now flush against the waifish figure of hers. His hand lingers over her right hip, fingers digging a little deeper for purchase. Her own hand flies, swats over his, clutching it hard in resistance. His knuckles are swollen, skin flaky, a result from breaking Adolf LeClerc’s nose when he called James many an unpleasant thing. His very alluring, but very vexing wife was there to witness the altercation -- which Emma was present for, likewise. Although rightly angered, Sophia held a look of satisfaction in her dark beetle eyes, hardly taking them off James's the whole time. She can never figure the woman out, she supposes, and she probably she never will.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She feels the heat blossom, the sticky wetness pool between her thighs. It was always this easy to get her going. She hates how effortless James makes it to be. The soapy water sloshing over wine goblets and stoneware sound borderline pornographic to her ears.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"But do</strong><strong>n't get blown away by the promise of such research. The math is sound but the variables change over time." </strong><em>Play dead, Emma. He'll tell you soon enough.</em> She leans back, pressing a little into him, her back flat against his chest. He buries his nose into her hair, inhaling deeply, a reflexive gesture.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"New shampoo?"</strong> He sweeps her knickers to the side, thinks twice, and decides to forgo the hindrance. He pulls at it hard once, enough to destroy the seams. They drop to her heels noiselessly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"Does it not smell the same?"</strong> She was quick to respond, while supplying her mind with a new curiousity that she feels will linger for days and days on end. Questions abound, logical and absurd: If seven weeks was too long, if all the wind from the turbines he helped construct dulled him of his olfactory senses? She must have formulated this batch incorrectly, despite her reputation as one of the most exacting and precise individuals in the field of chemistry. Emma wonders if he just forgot -- he did whisk himself away to some place devoid of warm bodies. How easy it was to unremember roses and geraniums to an extent, of what he has once or twice declared smelling of home was the question.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James's fingers ghost dangerously close to her centre. She grinds down into his hardness in an attempt to will her doubts away. <strong>"It's better."</strong> She tries to forget everything about their short exchange and keeps her rotating her hips in a maddening rhythm. She wants to make him lose it. <strong>"Absolutely better than you've ever had,"</strong> he breathes through his nose, still as evenly as his usual collected self does, despite her doubling efforts. The gemstone inexplicably weighs heavier now, as if it wasn't comfortably nestling on her breastbone a second ago.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <strong>"I am to accept BP's appointment as head of ICAM. I'll be working on something much more... practical."</strong>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Petrol. Her mind takes her to oil spills.</p>

<p><strong>"You're--"</strong> Emma stills for a half-second, tries to find her voice -- and succeeds.</p>

<p><strong>"You're fraternising with--"</strong> James reaches for her clit and flicks it with his index finger. She bites back a moan.</p>

<p>
  <strong>"Who you swore to fight."</strong>
</p>

<p>The enemy. The accusal was evident. James laughs softly in response.</p>

<p>He eases the same slender finger into her cunt without warning. <strong>"You're deliciously wet, Lockely. Your body..."</strong></p>

<p>
  <strong>"...betrays your disappointment."</strong>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She welcomes another one, and a low whimper escapes her mouth. He begins his ministrations, dipping further inside and curling, pushing just there, and then out, circling her clit with slight pressure. And just as she aches for one more, he rewards her with a third. Emma grits her teeth, wanting to bite down on something, someone. She settles for her lower lip and tastes the metallic tang of her blood as her flesh breaks. The sink, left untouched, was threatening to overflow, to drip down the wooden counter he fixed for her last summer, and flood the kitchen tiling they picked out from an artisanal shop specialising in fired clay bricks. They both pay it no mind. He purrs in enjoyment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James wraps his left arm around her chest, and she latches onto it for dear life. <strong>"I happen to be in the mood and play nice with Big Oil. It's a chess game--"</strong> He's pumping in and out of her now, pace unhurried at first, seemingly timed with a metronome due to the precision of his thrusts. <strong>"and it'll take decades for our efforts to see fruition if we have it your way. So, if I don't act now..."</strong> She mistakes his actions for listlessness until his touches take a sharp turn, now frenetic and almost painful, with his arm tightening around her, as though he wants to knock the wind out of her lungs. <strong>"Ours?"</strong> She manages to ask. She wanted no part in poisoning the earth of carbon and methane in exchange for resources.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He begins thrusting unto her backside, in synchronicity with his fingers caressing her insides. <strong>"You, are complicit in this, sweetheart."</strong> His unforgiving strokes send her over the edge as clamps down on him, whether her cunt wants to suck his hand in or push it out, she cannot tell. Her body convulses against his, and James helps her further along by massaging her earlobe with his tongue, a tenderness he hardly displays during their lovemaking. <strong>"After all, you demonstrated how to infiltrate organisations."</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>She turns her head around and captures his mouth for a deep, searching kiss. He bites down on her lower lip, breaking fresh the wound she earlier caused. He sucks what little blood that trickles from it and coaxes her mouth, her smart and greedy mouth open, resuming their all-consuming kiss anew. Emma licks the seams, corners of his, and forces his tongue for a light spar, while scratching his scalp, tugging his hair a smidge forcefully than normal -- which brings forth tiny flashes of equal pain and pleasure all over his body, most of to his lower extremities.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"They want my secrets,"</strong> he breathes into her. The smugness was evident in his tone, needing no mirror to confirm. She hears the zipper of his fly -- metal against metal clinking against each other, and she reaches back, finding his erection, hot and smooth and wraps her delicate fingers around the base a little loosely. She pumps him, languid, shaky and stuttering at first, a learned manner thanks to more than five years of... fornicating, as James as termed it. He has admitted more than once that the tentativeness, faux innocence she puts on makes him want her more. And tonight, she wants more of what he can give. Heat pools low in her belly, yet again. She will never want him less, she concludes. Emma wonders if he feels the same.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He takes advantage of this momentary distraction and grabs her shoulders, forcing her to face him. <strong>"They know time is running out."</strong> A normal person, she supposes, might have delivered the sentiment with a severity that calls for serious discussion, but all James supplies her with is an upturned mouth corner with a scheming glint in his eye.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He turns the faucet off, raising his eyebrows as if to prove a point. He divests themselves of their clothing fairly in seconds, still elegantly so, all but one -- her brassiere. He takes his time to peel it from her body, using his teeth to pull the straps down, inch by inch. He leaves a trail of glistening wetness from her clavicles to her upper arms. Finally, he unclasps it from her back, and let it fall to the floor, along with what's left of her propriety. His mouth latches onto her left nipple, while rolling the other to tautness.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>"I must say, they offered a lot of money,"</b> he speaks against her skin. He crouches, and drags his mouth down her stomach, to her navel, and spends an inordinate amount of time laving the area. Emma keeps pulling at his hair but successfully restrains her craving to draw jagged lines on his back.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James presses the side of his cheek to her middle and all he hears is a rumbling of sorts, faint but dismal sounding. <strong>"Unfettered access to the best labs on earth."</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>He looks up and fixes her a look of longing she wants to wish away. <strong>"Connections. Old. And new."</strong> She nods absently, and tries to get him on his feet, to feel his erection press against her, in and out of her. She is overcome by hunger to see his face when he comes -- she wants to be seen as well. He takes one last look at her flat belly and rises to tower over her. He picks her up by the legs and deposits her on the nearest counter.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He enters her in one swift thrust. It is nothing like the last time. Just as the last time was nothing like the one before it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <strong>"Power."</strong>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The word drips sensually from his lips. She thinks she has never heard of any other utterance filled with reverence. Not in the same vein, not even close to that time he was chanting her name like a prayer, as the back of her throat took his bruising thrusts to his completion.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She feels him stretch her into nothingness. He starts moving in her with an alarming urgency, proceeds with biting her all over the place to leave a collection of misshapen rubies he will gaze fondly at, later. He grips her rear too hard -- she's sure to earn a few mottled bruises there, too. For James, pain is pleasure, and her pleasure is exclusively for his benefit. There is nothing more to their partnership than a shared bed and study and this is what she tells herself every day, for thinking otherwise will throw her sanity off a cliff altogether. He eventually reaches and nips her inner arm, the unexpected jolt of pain brings her back to reality.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"Will corrupt you,"</strong> she laments. She reaches for her clit to heighten her pleasure, and James, in a rare act of generousity, allows her just so.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"You love it when I corrupt you."</strong> Two words of contrasting virtues. She cannot deny its truth but cannot vouch for its absolute certainty. She opens her mouth to validate him, for he makes her feel so full, so good, so desirable, but James doesn't want placation. <strong>"No need to speak it into existence."</strong> He pumps harder into her now, his eyes are getting wild, his voice straining against his throat. Emma decides to offer her piece anyway.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>'"We have always lived in lies,"</strong> she grits out. But her words only manage to excite him more. He raises both her legs up high in the air and changes his tempo, pounding into her without mercy, mercy she will never ask for.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She tries to catch her breath and continues, <strong>"and half-truths."</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"Look at me,"</strong> he implores. Her eyes remain closed. She senses him hovering a few inches over him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>"Emma,"</strong> he calls her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She opens her eyes to search his face.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
  <strong>"I have never done anything with half a heart."</strong>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James stares her down, a smouldering intensity of unfathomable emotions so overwhelming that it makes her come violently -- her release a sudden crash, a maverick collapsing over her body, tumbling and tumbling her to shore, as he rocks into her, piston fast and implacable -- He molds his mouth over hers, swallowing her pretty cries that push him to his own release. He empties thick ribbons and ribbons of his seed inside her, too much of it, a fact she discovers when she feels him dripping from their place of joining down her lithe legs. His hips are still moving, no longer forceful but thrusting slowly, back and forth into her wonderfully sore cunt until he stops all movement, oddly choosing to enclose himself by her warmth. Her legs feel like the blancmange they had for dessert.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>James hardly feels fully sated after a single coupling -- he'll normally give her ten to regroup and then proceed to ravish her cunt, drinking both their juices, akin to a sherpa downing gallons of water after finally reaching the foot of the Himalayas. Or fuck her from behind, in front of a mirror, showing her how they fit perfectly together.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Emma looks down at the ruby necklace he gave her, hoping for an answer to a question she is too terrified to ask. <em>Do you have a heart? Does it beat for anyone?</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>She never realises that she says all of this out loud for him to hear. Her mind drifts away to the future, a world war of the grandest scale, widespread drought and famine, and death, so much death that the living cannot bury all of them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He laces their fingers together and rests his forehead on hers. James offers three, four words. She doesn't catch any of it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She tilts her head up and finds that she cannot look him in the eye. She diverts her focus to his neck -- she spots a shadow of a crescent moon scar under a blooming bruise. Emma feels the need to mark him again. It is always the same predilections with James, and she never tires of it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He repeats himself; but she hears nothing but an indistinct set of vowels and consonants that make no sense to her. She decides to wrap her arms around him and wishes him a Happy Christmas. He hums in assent and embraces her tighter.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His gift, unopened, a leather-bound diary, waits for him under the pine tree.</p>

<p>He hears his heart beat wildly in his ears, and he does not appreciate the unusual lack of silence. A crescendo, far from its normal pitter-patter calmness, unnerving, but a guiding development. Silence tethers him to his regular orderliness and today, he feels unmade. He has hit the right mark though, it is the eve of 1926 turning 1927. James Lloyd is wading through uncharted territory with a fresh approach. But she, is the most familiar of sights, and the room, a decade of memories he doesn't feel beholden to. Barnardo’s is as decrepit as it has ever been. Oh, the irony.</p>

<p>Her eyes widen at the sight of him, and he just smiles inwardly in kind. They recognise each other, and it is the same visceral response he gets from her -- one of absolute loathing. </p>

<p>He reminds himself that this Emma had not been thoroughly acquainted with this James yet, even though he is essentially unchanged. And with her, standing before him, feet wide apart with her hands grasping the cradle's edge for life, he can tell. He can tell that she lives ferociously through her goal, singular and writ in stone, which is to stop him from destroying the world, but all the while unaware of her own tragic fate, her mother's to be precise, awaiting them in 1979.</p>

<p>James watches her aim the .357 Magnum at him, ready to shoot through his head, also her safety is off -- was it off the last time, it was, wasn't it?</p>

<p>So he disarms her, not particularly fond of a duel threatening to materialise in seconds, for it is just another version of a deadly dance they've similarly engaged in before.</p>

<p>It was stimulating for the first few, chiefly when he came out of top. Which was, for the lack of a better phrase, most of it, his brain smugly acknowledges. But she remains a welcome challenge. On more than one occasion, battle hardened Emma offered two or three nasty tricks hidden up her sleeve to pull out a victory from behind. They were well-earned; he did not slack off. And this observation that he realises just about now, invites him to wager with himself that their moments were stowed away, deep in her subconscious.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he can't indulge himself enough with the idea to believe it truly possible. He abandons the thought.</p>

<p>The laws of physics cannot be bent, that much he knows. Everything is random happenstance leading to a fixed destiny.</p>

<p>But he is a time-traveler. And so is she. They have already defied special and general relativity's boundaries. What else is there that waits to be discovered? A wrinkle in the continuum to exploit?</p>

<p>Time can only dictate the rules.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He is unaging, and he can move through centuries with relative ease. While time is now something he can afford to spend, James can only go through the same motions so much for some things hardly change -- that is his impatience with experiments lacking in tangible results, plus letting her fight him again is just a waste of energy.</p>

<p>But he wants to wipe that look off her face that greets his every arrival. And he supposes, it is the only objective, seeing he cannot accomplish anything that will alter the trajectory of her future, permanently displaced from a reality where they both belong in each others' arms again.</p>

<p>It is a filthy, anthropoidal thought of his, but he has no other fixations as of late. However, it's a hopeless case to deny he is not obsessed with the idea of owning her soul -- her entirety, for he is a greedy man. And greedy men do not settle. They start small, but their designs are never lacking in grandeur.</p>

<p>He tackles her to the ground, pinning her hands together and deposits himself on top of her, straddling her waist while lowering his chest so their faces align and eyes level with each other. He intends only to restrict her movements, but their positions look positively lecherous from any observer.</p>

<p>As if to break the tension, he hears cries, his cries -- infant-James, a puny thing of untapped greatness -- waking to the sounds of their mini-scuffle. The incessant wailing increasing in volume is agonising to the both of them, "for babies are the most annoying creatures on earth," as per Emma, circa 1998. And if adult-James were a shade more annoyed than he is at the moment, he would've shot his hours-old self in the throat to relieve him of unwanted distractions -- the syrupy blood sloshing around his head is ample enough. And most of all, he just needs to be heard.</p>

<p>James exhales soundlessly and narrows his eyes at her.</p>

<p>"Stop fidgeting. I'm not going to hurt you, as much as you want to believe that I will."</p>

<p>She keeps struggling, writhing against his body, which sends not-wanted spikes of not-pleasure, he tells himself, towards his lower extremities. "You had no reservations about it for years," Emma retorts, while kicking and kneeing his back, and he accepts them like a not-lover's embrace. Her slight figure, untouched by time, is still pliant and pleasantly rounded; her breasts not-so-plump as he'd always committed to memory, her waist still too small to wrap his arms around with, and her face, seems to have grown more beautiful notwithstanding an affixed cruelness that should mar it. He keeps his composure, mind set on confessing a few truths he has long withheld since he paid her his first visit.</p>

<p>It is his 77th, if anyone is counting. It can be a chore to go through, but it is not in any degree one for him.</p>

<p>James wills his hot bloodedness to cool down. Rape is an option, but six minutes is far from satisfying particularly with an now-involuntary participant, even if they have danced the horizontal tango in record-breaking numbers, in the past.</p>

<p>"You're a smart girl, aren't you, Emma?" His breath fans a few strands of her curly hair away from her face, and he decides he likes this position despite the lack of fornicating involved. He can annoy her, and charm her at the same time.</p>

<p>"Not as brilliant as you, Lloyd Jr.," she spits out. The insult does not quite land, but he understands the intention behind it all the same. His well-manicured hair, his wavy fringe in particular catches some of her spittle; also gets trapped under his eyelashes. He can't help but be chuffed at the idea that this is how they trade bodily fluids now, but he tells himself that he must take whatever he gets. "I can never compare, Lord of the Flies," Emma adds, derision dripping from every word.</p>

<p>James's ears pick up that her voice is uncustomarily rough around the edges, as if she had swallowed a spiked toad or five hundred grams of candy, and he further notices a bit of a wet streak on her cheeks, a pair of them, leading him to wonder what could have spurred their existence. She was about to murder a child, who he opines is special, but possesses no single innocent bone out of 305, bless his mother and father in hell -- so how could she mourn the potential loss of a downright evil no matter the form? Maybe they are fruits of delirious joy, the relief that she was about to right things, but probably not, he argues. He offers his younger self no pity. The little demon is without of any knowledge, just potential. He makes a mental note to keep looking for another period in time that assures him a meeting with the ever-elusive Emmaline Lockely. Preferably a Emma who is a smidge less temperamental, and no other Jameses or Lloyds in the picture. He's not fond of sharing, even with his other selves.</p>

<p>Yes, he ascertains that she's too mad to care, drowning in the feelings her vengeance to hear him out, but he goes on about his frustrations. This wasn't what he rehearsed a million times before; it is completely devoid of ardour, but he can re-do the whole thing and she would be none the wiser.</p>

<p>"If you had ten minutes," he begins again, "six now, actually, since you've been uncooperative -- How would you convince someone of your--"</p>

<p>"--downright sordid feelings for them," he stresses,</p>

<p>"Desires of the basest nature that you'd rather dispose of,"</p>

<p>"if such thing is possible?"</p>

<p>He feels millions of imaginary ants crawling on his skin as he utters the words, the insects eager to bite down, taste his blood and discover his concealed adulation for another being, his humanity that he tries so hard to bury beneath layers of complexities that no one can decipher no matter how hard they try.</p>

<p>Her expression changes from disdain to unwelcome confusion, and something else he thinks he fantasises, as he slowly lets go of her wrists in an attempt to gain her confidence,  unmounts her and rises to his feet. She follows suit. Making her feel safe will probably help even though it changes nothing, he reminds himself for the umpteenth time -- not the past, present or future. He just wants to banish her anger to outer space, and he has succeeded by throwing her off so far.</p>

<p>He desires to be the reason for the softening of her features, and right now, the set of her jaw is still too rigid, the creases on her forehead deep, unsightly from her eyebrows knitting together, and the hard line of her chapped lips -- all of it makes up a painful, grotesque picture that twists his stomach into clove hitches, no, constrictor knots that hurts him physically, if it were even possible, and he wonders, what he would give to see a small upward curve gracing the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"What's worse -- is that they are affections,"</p>

<p>"--that said person returned with the most fiery of passions--" he sounds amused now, tickled by the ever-changing emotion that paints her visage -- conscpicuous interest, skepticism, and a return to disgust which was an expected eventuality.</p>

<p>"--but all she will ever remember is their mutual, unending hatred for each other."</p>

<p>He would act similarly if he was in her shoes. Probably call her names -- a lunatic, a charlatan, or an occultist.</p>

<p>"With good reason, might I add. Although obviously, I don't loathe you as much."</p>

<p>"I killed your friends. I corrupted the world as you know it. I reveled in it all."</p>

<p>James delivers the line with impeccable matter-of-factliness. Free of stutter, cadence steady as seconds ticking by. He regrets nothing, and it could not be more apparent to Emma.  <br />
"I lost--" he halts his train of thought and attempts to start anew.</p>

<p>The pause gives her a window of opportunity, and out of nowhere Emma punches him square in the face, a thwack that sends him a few steps backwards. The jab, he realises has hurt her knuckles as her sudden grimace betrays her strength. James backs up some more, instinctively away from her, clutching his bleeding and very broken nose. She wastes no time as he fixes its alignment and scrambles for the gun he flung earlier towards the nursery's corner. She succeeds in retrieving it, and they return to square one, the Anderson Wheeler Mark VII pointing at ignorant infant-James, and then back towards his skull.</p>

<p>"Good choice, my sweet," he goads.</p>

<p>He hears it click.</p>

<p>Too many times in succession.</p>

<p>It brings him no pain. He is unharmed. Athough he feels... he feels...</p>

<p>Time to stop playing games, and put his foot down.</p>

<p>"You died. You don't exist in my world anymore."</p>

<p>Emma is unfazed by the news. He expected no less of a reaction. He wishes he was this brave, oh, only if he were a lesser man, but on second thought, immortality is the bane of his existence.</p>

<p>James sits on a stool with uneven legs by the door, and motions for her to do the same with the gaudy armchair decked in geometric print across the floor. He fishes out a white, pristine handkerchief from his pant pocket, its three initials visible on its lower right corner, and wipes the red dripping down his philtrum. Her eyes spot the insignia, and they lose some of their unyielding hardness but she remains rooted on the spot, and pulls the trigger again. He hears the firearm crackle once more, this time a little louder. Still, no bullet exits the revolver. That's the seventh chamber, he counts. The cylinder is, was not loaded, not even blanks. She keeps her aim steady, despite the gun's obvious inability to pose a real threat to any soul in the room. Infant-Lloyd is still whinging about, acting as background noise to offset the sounds of chrome-molybdenum steel cylinders revolving.</p>

<p>But he... he feels like he's been shot, and is dying a slow, aching death by the hands of his lover. His next words sound pained, his breathing uneven, laboured. He believes it to be the aftereffects of shattered nasal cavities.</p>

<p>"I'm just here to set myself up for failure... and witness the woman I long for and wish to possess,"</p>

<p>He waves his free hand and snaps his fingers twice, "disappear without a trace for the thousandth time."</p>

<p>Emma lowers her gun with reticence, and appears relenting to a cease-fire, but rapidly hurls it at him that its muzzle almost hits his nose -- again -- if he wasn't so agile to dodge the offending item. It leaves a small dent on the wall. Mrs. Tennyson will not like that, just as she despises everything that graces her presence. As he recovers from the surprise attack, James notices her hands resting on her hips, the right still holding on to the bloodied article. He interprets it as an act of surrender however hostile; he has her full attention and she is waiting for his next words to come.</p>

<p>"So as I was saying, I've tried to let you go, for more instances than I'd like to admit." James keeps going, and nothing can stop him. He's opened Pandora's box, and he has no energy left to resist unleashing his vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>"But I find, much to my satisfaction or dissatisfaction, I'm not certain which is stronger, that I simply... cannot. I keep returning here. You teach me something new about myself every day, dear Minister."</p>

<p>"Although as fate or luck would have it, I am the only one left with the burden of memory -- our memories. But let it be known that there is no... love lost between us. Just fondness. Familiarity." And with this James suspects, that it is not only the wretched woman's heart that he is trying to appeal to.</p>

<p>"What else can I exactly do with ten minutes anyway?"</p>

<p>He finishes his monologue, and laughs at the incredulousness of it all, and it echoes off the walls of the room, mocking him, as if the beginnings of a sneer on her wasn't enough.</p>

<p>Silence, now, saturates him with poison. He cannot sense the churning in his head anymore.</p>

<p>And their time, their time is drawing to a close.</p>

<p>"Say something," James <s>begs</s> commands her. He's doubtful if he can accept futility on his attempt number, well, any numerical figure including the number seven. But luck, he presumes, is firmly encamped on his side today.</p>

<p>Emma finally sits down, chest heaving, and opens her mouth wide enough to speak. She freezes for a beat, a period so interminable he swears it feels like a minute that extended to a hour in a hot second. The hesitation allows James to mentally conjure a garter snake, slithering down her insides and making its nest in her belly. Devouring her from the within. Or influencing her every action, mainly coercing her to bite the forbidden apple. He means no ill will, but gets a kick out of giving her imaginary torment in retaliation to her physical manhandling of him.</p>

<p>These thoughts are just the usual workings of his perverse imagination.</p>

<p>"Good for you," she scoffs, having finally found her voice.</p>

<p>How anticlimactic of a response, he muses.</p>

<p>She stands up and makes her way towards him, purposefully slowing down her steps, but stops just a half-foot before the edges of his scuffed brogues. She dips her head down and leans into his bloodied face, examining the stained piece of cloth with vested interest.</p>

<p>Emma snatches it away from his fingers and turns her back on him, all in lightning speed. Both her hands seem to be busy unfolding the pocket square, but his line of vision is obstructed by her slender back. What he is certain of, is that she will realise the fine embroidery spells out  E. J. L., as she suspected earlier. He catches a glimpse of her knuckle joints, and they are rosy, and he swears by the moon, that the sides of her cheeks are of the same colouring.</p>

<p>"And to answer your question, what you could do..." She starts articulating clearly, as if making sure he hears every single syllable that rolls off her tongue,</p>

<p>"I suppose you can kill yourself -- and help us all."</p>

<p>She spins about face, beaming at him with her canines, and her eyes teeming with maniacal schaudenfreude.</p>

<p>There. The smile he has long waited for, not borne out of love or joy, but not displeasing. He cannot determine what he should feel on his own, but the expression warms his fingertips just enough to forgo leather gloves and still escape frostbites from the chilly December nighttime weather. It reaches his toes, and James reckons he can lose the socks too. She'd like that.</p>

<p>Par for the course, Emma, he humours himself.</p>

<p>And without another second to spare, she vanishes into thin air. The square settles to the parqueted floor, gathers what he assumes is dust and mold, and the beginnings of what he will learn to name as despair, tinged with sufferance later.</p>

<p>He picks it up and inhales its scent, amid the clotting blood blocking his nostrils.</p>

<p>Nothing. He smells nothing.</p>

<p>The longing does not go away.</p>

<p>He glances over his shoulder and finds newly-orphaned-James staring back at him with an eager curiosity.</p>

<p>Adult-James sighs in exasperation. "I suggest, that you shut your mouth when I speak. This... won't be my last trip."</p>

<p>He sets the desk lamp to dim, crosses the room and switches the overhead light off.</p>

<p>"I have half a mind to murder you just to make her happy."</p>

<p>Infant-James faux-giggles in delight, as if he understands his anguished mutterings.</p>

<p>The older Lloyd strides towards the nursery's entryway and shuts the door with a resounding clink, leaving his much younger self alone to rest in the darkness.</p>

<p>"You are as alone as I am, and ever will be," he whispers to no one.</p>
